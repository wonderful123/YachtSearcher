- Don't deep visit already visited pages. See http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html#duplicates-filter
- Deep scraping: pass the item through the meta value and add to it there.
- Output to JSON
- Output with date/time
- Command line optional location data
- Location optional from command line. Or process afterwards as seperate pipeline. Makes more sense.
- Add scrape depth to command line
- Add to deep scraped if visited
